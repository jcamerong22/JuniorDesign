Swarm Bot Project 

The goal of this semester-long project is to model and simulate the naviga-
tion and environmental sensing of autonomous vehicles by designing an intelligent swarmbot
team using a community of two bots. The two bots are to work together, collaborating to solve
the problem of safe navigation.
